# Statistical-Learning-for-Preventive-Maintenance

Failure prediction is a major focus area in predictive maintenance in several industries, such as the aerospace industry. Failure prediction helps aircraft manufacturers adopt proactive maintenance practices, aimed at minimising failures and resulting downtime.

This project looks into aircraft engine sensor data together with time in number of engine cycles, which have been used to train machine learning models to predict failures on unseen engine data.
